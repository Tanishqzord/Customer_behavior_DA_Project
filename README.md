# 🛒 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

A complete SQL + Python + Power BI project to understand customer behavior and drive business decisions

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes 3,900 retail transactions to uncover what drives customer purchases, loyalty, and spending patterns.
The goal is to help a retail company improve sales, customer engagement, and marketing strategy by understanding real consumer behavior.

This project includes:

Python for data cleaning, preparation & feature engineering

PostgreSQL / MySQL for structured data modeling & analysis

Power BI for interactive dashboards & business insights

🎯 Business Problem

Management observed shifting customer preferences across demographics, product types, discounts, shipping options, and subscriptions.
The central question was:

“How can the company use customer shopping data to identify trends and improve marketing, product strategy, and customer loyalty?”


Business Problem Document

🧹 1. Data Preparation (Python)

Key steps performed:

Loaded and explored the dataset

Handled missing values (median imputation for review ratings)

Engineered new features (age groups, purchase frequency)

Integrated data into a SQL database for further analysis



🧠 2. Data Analysis (SQL)

Using SQL, I analyzed:

Customer segments (New, Returning, Loyal)

High-value and discount-driven shoppers

Shipping preferences impact on spend

Gender-wise revenue contribution

Product ratings & satisfaction trends

📊 3. Visualization (Power BI)

Built an interactive dashboard highlighting:

Revenue by gender

Discount behavior and high-value spenders

Top-rated products

Shipping preference trends

Subscription impact on revenue & loyalty

Customer segmentation (Loyal, Returning, New)



🔑 Key Insights

Women contribute slightly higher revenue than men → potential for targeted marketing

Express shipping users spend 12% more per transaction

Subscribers contribute 45% of revenue and show a 78% repeat rate

Top-rated products (Blouse, Dress, Shirt) show strong customer satisfaction

50% of customers are first-time buyers → opportunity to improve onboarding & retention



🚀 Strategic Recommendations

Introduce Loyalty Rewards for returning customers

Target Premium Segments like express-shipping users

Promote Top-Rated Products in marketing campaigns

Convert New → Returning → Loyal through improved retention strategies
